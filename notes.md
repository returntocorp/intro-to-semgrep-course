## Errors

* Referencing a branch that doesn't exist in template repo
* Referencing `main` when creating a new PR fails.
  * Why did `welcome` fail and not `setup-semgrep`?
* Referencing a file that doesn't exist in messages
* Having a `respond` after a `respond` seems to fail
  * Adding an `issue: 1` for a PR seems to make it fail, even when broken up with a `mergeBranch` in between.
  * Moving `mergeBranch` between and removing `issue: 1` on the second one seems to work.
* `{{}}` vs `%var` in different contexts - why?
* Having a responses.md file that references a `{{ variable }}` that isn't sent via a `data`.
* Template repo being too big - there's a max size
* Description cap size at 255
* Online editor IDE deletes all comments
* When you push commits view online editor it doesn't sync the course, you have
  to do that manually
* Creating a PR -> Comment -> PR, the second PR is #3, even though it's only the second one (https://github.com/practical-program-analysis/intro-to-semgrep/pull/3). The Issue is #2.
  * Maybe this is intended behavior to differentiate #'s in comments?
  

## Building the Course

~~~bash
git checkout -b welcome
~~~

Add the following to README.md at the top

```
This is a fork of Juice Shop being used for Semgrep training. Major thanks to the creators and maintainers!
```

Push branch and create PR.

Title: Welcome to Semgrep! Getting Set Up

Copy in `01_welcome.md` 

Fix a bunch of the copy to remove references to the bot.


# semgrep.yml

## Next Steps

Copy the following YAML into [.github/workflows/semgrep.yml]({{ url }}).

~~~yaml
name: Semgrep
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  semgrep:
    name: Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      INPUT_PUBLISHURL: https://dev.semgrep.dev
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
        with:
          publishToken: ${{ secrets.SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN }}
          publishDeployment: TODO
~~~

### Manual Set Up

If you'd prefer to set things up manually, here's what you can do:

1. Set up Semgrep's API token.
   1. Within the Dashboard, go to the [Settings page](https://semgrep.dev/manage/settings) and create a new Semgrep token.
   2. Navigate to this repo's [Secrets page]({{ secrets_setting_url }}), create a new repository secret named `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN`, and copy in the token value from the prior step.
2. Configure `semgrep.yml` to point to your Dashboard account.
   1. On the Dashboard [Settings page](https://semgrep.dev/manage/settings), copy the value of `publishDeployment`, and paste it into [`semgrep.yml` in this repo]({{ url }}), replacing the `TODO`.
   2. Click the "Start commit" button and select "Commit directly to the `setup-semgrep` branch."


## 04_semgrep-merge-response.md


I've opened another PR for us to work from, [click here]({{ url }}) to continue.

**Troubleshooting**
If that's not the case, make sure you've set up `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN` as a repo secret in this project, and that you've put in the right value for `publishDeployment` in `semgrep.yml`. See more detailed instructions above.

üõ†Ô∏è = user, ü§ñ = Lab
ü§ñ Before - forks vulnerable repo
* Set the Semgrep repo secret
ü§ñ Set up semgrep.yml
ü§ñ Issue PR with X == X and watch it fail
üõ†Ô∏è Change the code to 3 = 5 or something else and have it succeed
üõ†Ô∏è Walk briefly though Semgrep App - what it does, where things are
* Intro to ellipses operator - block eval(...)
* Intro to metavar
* Warn on new route - audit only
* Create owasp_devslop community Slack channel - point webhook there
* Audit @csrf_exempt or other authn/authz
