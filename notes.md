## Errors

* Referencing a branch that doesn't exist in template repo
* Referencing `main` when creating a new PR fails.
  * Why did `welcome` fail and not `setup-semgrep`?
* Referencing a file that doesn't exist in messages
* `{{}}` vs `%var` in different contexts - why?
* Having a responses.md file that references a `{{ variable }}` that isn't sent via a `data`.
* Template repo being too big - there's a max size
* Description cap size at 255
* Online editor IDE deletes all comments
* When you push commits view online editor it doesn't sync the course, you have
  to do that manually
